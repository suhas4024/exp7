The code you provided applies a Butterworth low-pass filter to an image using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Here is a brief explanation of the process:

Butterworth Low-Pass Filter: A low-pass filter is used to allow frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency to pass while attenuating higher frequencies. 
The Butterworth filter is defined by its order and cutoff frequency, and it has a smooth frequency response with no ripples.

DFT and Filtering: The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is used to convert the image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.
The filter is then applied by multiplying the DFT of the image with the Butterworth filter in the frequency domain.

Inverse DFT: After applying the filter, the inverse DFT is used to convert the image back to the spatial domain.

Normalization and Display: The filtered image is normalized to the range [0, 255] for visualization and then displayed.
